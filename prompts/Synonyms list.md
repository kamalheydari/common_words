    <li>Foundational (adj)- / found-ay-shun-al / faʊnˈdeɪʃənəl / - Relating to or forming the base or foundation of something.</li>
    <li>Fundamental (adj)- / fun-duh-men-tal / fʌndəˈmentəl / - Forming or relating to the most basic and important parts of something.</li>
    <li>Establish (v)-/ es-tab-lish / ɪˈstæb.lɪʃ / - To set up or found (an organization, system, etc.).</li>

    <li>Set up (v)- / set up / sɛt ʌp / - To arrange or prepare something for use or operation.</li>
  </ul>

   <p>Shared Meaning: These words are related to building, creating, or setting up something from the ground up.</p>

   <p style="direction: rtl">Fa - Shared Meaning: این کلمات مربوط به ساخت، ایجاد یا راه اندازی چیزی از ابتدا هستند.</p>

   <p>
   Tips and Tricks: Pay attention to the prefixes and suffixes of these words to better understand their meanings. For example, "found-" is related to building or creating, while "-al" is related to something being fundamental or basic. Also, be careful not to confuse "found" with "find", as they have different meanings.
